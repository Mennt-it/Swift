## Analyse and measure traffic with Google Analytics 4
* Google announced that Google Analytics 3 (Universal) will no longer be supported July 1st 2023. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) will take its place because of GDPR and Cookie issues in the current Google Analytics 3.
* Swift is releasing GA4, where the ecommerce events are supported. This will enable you to see e.g. **Monetisation on E-commerce purchases, Engagement events & conversions**
* GA4 gives you a more intelligent user privacy and tracking features, it gives users more intuitive and precise control over what personal data is collected, which is important to help your business comply with current and future privacy regulations.
* With GA4 you can analyse your ecommerce website, by measuring traffic and engagement across your websites. You will get simplified goals and events setup, which was a complex set up before regarding transactional functions such checkouts.
* Swift supports Debug view mode, enable the debug mode in website settings and you can debug real-time report that GA4 provides, track data immediately when testing on your website. (You need to be login in DW backend in order to use debug view mode for testing)

## Content marketing

### Content search
* Help visitors find what they are looking for on the website either products or content information. Content search can help visitors to quickly find new information about the companyâ€™s business e.g. through articles. 
* Swift has product search, but now content search is also available. Content search can be used together with the product search or by itself e.g. if you have a website that does not include ecommerce.

### Better Responsive behaviour
* Improve the visual presentation of your website on smaller devices.
* Define how your content elements should be placed: stacked, side by side. 
* Control spacing and padding and define which column what should be placed first.

## B2B solution

### Create & Manage users
* Easier way for Sales representative to create & manage customers. A sales rep. has the opportunity to create and manage users in Customer center
* This allows the Sales rep. to create new users in frontend, without logging in the backend administration. The sales rep. can get a list of customers that he/she has created and see an overview over who has accepted their invitation.
* This is a strong functionality that can be used together with impersonation, when a sales rep. can create an order on-behalf of their customers.

## GDPR, Compliance, Lighthouse score & Schema.org

### Google fonts
* Google hosted fonts can be violating the EU privacy regulation in some EU countries, i.e. Germany, therefore Google font is now downloaded and served from the solution.

### Alt text
* Add Alt text for images on content elements. Alt text is used for visitors that are unable to see the images on the website, but uses tool such as screen readers

### Heading level
* SEO requires there should always be a < h1 > on a content page. Define heading level on the content elements by settings h-tags e.g.  < h1 > < h2 >. As default we set < h2 >

### Schema.org
* Schema.org helps the search engine to better understand the info that is on the website, to have a more rich search result. Schema.org has been added for articles , employee and block quotes elements
