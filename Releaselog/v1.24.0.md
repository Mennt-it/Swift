>
> **Benefits**
> * Swift v.1.24.0 templates can run both on a DW9 and DW10 solution
> * Bugfixes & latest feature releases will be available in Github
> * Swift can now run on a DW10 without the _'template compatibility mode'_  on a DW10 solution

## Added
### Publications component on Swift
* Publications was released end August 2023 - [Read more here](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/downloads/swift#sideNavTitle2)
* DynamicWeb Publications is a tool which allows you to create catalog, data sheets, price list through Visual Editor, based on product information from PIM. Publications can be used with own frontend implementation or with a Swift frontend.
* If you are using the Publications concept, Swift has now made support for using it in e.g. Your commerce site or Digital Asset Portal by using  **ProductDownloadPublication** button component on the Product Detail page, so it is possible to use the Publication design, selecting language and currency and get data sheet.
* To use Publication it requires a set up & license
