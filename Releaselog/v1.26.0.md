> [!TIPS]
> * In website settings you can decide if you want to enable mini off-canvas and decide it's behaviour
> * In Content area under *Swift tools / Service / Cart summary* you need to ensure to link it to the proper pages: Cart, Checkout, Anonymouse checkout, Quote if they are not defined. Also check that the navigation tag 'CartSummary ' is set

### Checkout and parcelshop with Shipmondo

## Get an overview where Themes are used
Get an overview over where the specific themes are used on your website e.g. on pages, rows or paragraphs. This is useful to locate unused themes on the website, which can happen when experimenting with different colors on the website and need to clean up

## Enhance your e-commerce data

### Ecom menu related content 

A new Mega menu design called **MenuRelatedContent** can showcase both ecommerce groups and its related content pages.
This allows you to link to campaign and article pages directly from the mega menu. This menu is good if you have many sub product groups.

### Related products using Product component slider
Use related products on the Product detail page to make customers aware of other available products. On Swift it is possible to use product components to build the related products. This allows you to decide, which information to show and align the design with your product list.

Furthermore, it is possible to decide, which of the related product groups should be shown on the section, when designing the product detail page.

## Digital Assets Portal & Publication

* Publications was released end August 2023 - [Read more here](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/downloads/swift#sideNavTitle2)
* DynamicWeb Publications is a tool which allows you to create catalogue, data sheets, price lists through Visual Editor, based on the product information from PIM. Publications can be used with own frontend implementation or with a Swift frontend.
* If you are using the Publications concept, Swift has now made support for using it in e.g. Your commerce site or Digital Asset Portal by using  **ProductDownloadPublication** button component on the Product Detail page, so it is possible to use the Publication design, selecting language and currency and get data sheet.
* You can also use it on the **Download cart**, when creating price list sheet of multiple products.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Publication concept on Swift / DAP  it requires a set up & a Publications License

## Swift compatible on DynamicWeb10

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Swift had focus on rewriting the Swift templates removing several @ helper on the templates, since it was not compatible to .Net7
>  and using GetRawValue to improve performance.
>
> **Benefits**
> * Swift *v1.26.0* templates can run both on a DW9 and DW10 solution
> * Bugfixes & latest feature releases will be available in Github
> * Swift can now run on a DW10 **without** the _'template compatibility mode'_  on a DW10 solution
> * No duplicate templates on DW10
>
>If you have an existing Swift project v1.23.0 or on any previous versions you will meet more merge conflicts than usual when upgrading, which is expected for this Swift version. You should spend special attention to all your custom implementations as usual that are depended on our templates
