* But if you need to use Parcelshop in your solution this needs to be setup
* The new released database has already the setup for the new checkout flow

## DW10 Conversion
Swift has rewritten the razor templates so it is suitable to run both DW9 and DW10. This gives the opportunity to keep working on Swift projects in the future. Going from DW9 (.NET 4) to DW10 (.NET 7) gives some issues on the templates, since some elements are deprecated. The focus has been on the code that is not easily converted trough the DW10 template converter. 

**Focus areas on Swift**
* Rewritten helpers are deprecated in Razor​
* System.web and HttpContext is deprecated in .NET 7
* Any use of .NET 4 framework only APIs is deprecated​
* New razor parser in .NET 7 with minor changes to execution

## Removed

* Product info itemtype is removed
* Tiny slider is deprecated, we are using Swiffy slider instead  - Product detail image, Product media gallery, product slider
