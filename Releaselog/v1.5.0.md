## B2B - Express buy & better product overview 
* Search for SKUs and add products to cart quickly using the **express buy page**

* Two new **product list designs** – compact & list – make it easy to set up B2B-friendly product lists with more products & more technical details per page. 
* Support for adding **order references** during checkout, for solutions where references to an external system, like a procurement system, is a requirement. 
* You can now block out certain dates – single days, recurring weekdays & date ranges – from being selected via the **delivery date selector**

* Product lists now support showing **product group images and descriptions** – this makes it easier for the customer to distinguish between product groups at a glance
