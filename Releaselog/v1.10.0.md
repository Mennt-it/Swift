## B2B solution

In this release there is a focus on capabilities supporting especially requirements from B2B customers that are moving their sales to digital channels.

### Quotes & assisted selling

## Decrease implementation time 

Based on feedback from partners and developers ,significant improvements have been made in 3 areas that almost always requires some kind of customization. The information in product lists, on the product detail pages and the content in emails being send, mostly needs some kind of modification to match customer requirements.
Usually this causes several code changes that drives cost and complexity.
By utilizing the visual content builder in new ways, a lot of these customizations can be avoided and minimized resulting in faster and cheaper implementations.


### Build emails with Visual Editor
* Swift presents a new email concept where you can build beautiful newsletter emails through visual editor and re-use content and product data in emails.
* The plan with the new Email concept is also to design **System emails** using the visual content builder. This allows the email editor to visually design the system emails such order email, create account emails etc. Before changes to emails has to be done by developers directly in the templates â€“ with the new concept, content can be edited in the visual content builder. **Building system emails** will come later on

### Building blocks for product list and details
