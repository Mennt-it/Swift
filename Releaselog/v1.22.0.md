## Google Analytics & Tag Manager - Tracking 

Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager are supported in Swift, which will enable you to see e.g. Monetization on E-commerce purchases, Engagement events & conversions. Tracking is enabled when accepting DynamicWeb's cookie manager. However, when using a third party cookie manager this could sometimes be an issue.
Swift has reimplemented how cookies and tracking scripts are handled. When the DynamicWeb Cookie manager is disabled, Swift will allow tracking (this is changed compared to previous versions) which makes it possible to use Google Tag manager to inject external cookie scripts like Cookie Information and Cookiebot and let them handle when and how Analytics are loaded and how client side cookies are handled.

**Info**
* When using a third party cookie manager you can disable DynamicWeb's cookie manager under Settings / Web Http / Cookie Manager

## Inventories & Stock notifications
On the product detail page, product inventory can be an important information to show to the visitors, to let them know that the product is in stock. With this information we have extended som extra functionalities such as Stock state, Back in stock notifications email, Stock location overview. 

### Stock state
The labels on the Stock state were predefined in Swift. However, we now support the Stock State in DynamicWeb, where you can define your own labels on the stock levels based on its stock state. This allows you to provide your own message to the visitors. An addition to that it is possible to hide inventory number from stock component and only show the stock state label

* Create own labels based on stock levels
* Inform your visitor how many items that are left

### Back in Stock notifications

Notify the visitors when a product is back in stock with the back in stock notification component. This aims to sustain the initial visitors interest by coming back to the website and purchase the item, because it enables an alert and expectation of that the items will be restocked in the future.

* Aims to sustain the initial visitors interest
* With the back in stock notification you can create and design a system email and notify the visitors through email Marketing

### Stock location overview

Companies with multiple stock locations can now be presented in Swift. With the Stock location component
 it is possible for the visitors to get an overview over where the item is in Stock. 

* See if the item is in stock
* An overview over where the item is available
* Search for a specific location based on Location name and address

## Stand out with CSS Swift tool

Do you want to add your own design to standard? With Swift CSS tool you can add the customers design on the commerce projects. This can be done by adding Class name and CSS code through the Swift CSS tool concept, where the css code can be reused. This offers developers to add some ' decorations ' e.g. rounded corners, shadows or use standard bootstrap utilities on top of our standard elements.

* Add CSS without editing the Swift standard item types
* Make the CSS globally and reuse the code
* Part 1: Basic functionlity implmented on row and TextAdvanced

We heard your struggles with the database when starting a new project! Therefore, we present two different database types. 

**Database - with demo data:** 
* This database includes all the Swift content pages and ecommerce products data

**Database - with no ecommerce data:** 
* This database includes all the Swift content pages, but with no ecommerce data such as products, variants, related products. It is also been cleaned for Product fields and category fields and much more. *(Available the next couple of days)*
